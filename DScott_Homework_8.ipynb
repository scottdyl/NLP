    "Perform a vocabulary-based sentiment analysis of the movie reviews you used in homework 5 and homework 7, by doing the following:\n",
    "1.\tIn Python, load one of the sentiment vocabularies referenced in the textbook, and run the sentiment analyzer as explained in the corresponding reference. Add words to the sentiment vocabulary, if you think you need to, to better fit your particular text collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tFor each of the clusters you created in homework 7, compute the average, median, high, and low sentiment scores for each cluster. Explain whether you think this reveals anything interesting about the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tFor extra credit, analyze sentiment of chunks as follows:\n",
    "a.\tTake the chunks from homework 5, and in Python, run each chunk individually through your sentiment analyzer that you used in question 1. If the chunk registers a nonneutral sentiment, save it in a tabular format (the chunk, the sentiment score).\n",
    "b.\tNow sort the table twice, once to show the highest negative-sentiment-scoring chunks at the top and again to show the highest positive-sentiment-scoring chunks at the top. Examine the upper portions of both sorted lists, to identify any trends, and explain what you see. \n",
    "Submit all of your inputs and outputs and your code for this assignment, along with a brief written explanation of your findings. \n"
